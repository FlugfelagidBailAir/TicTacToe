## Tic-Tac-Toe

### 1. Summary
In this project we programmed the well known game, Tic Tac Toe and to do so we used the programming language Java coupled with javascript and HTML. Tic Tac Toe is a two player game and works like so, the first player has the symbol X and the latter player has the symbol O, the first player begins with placing an X into a tile on a 3x3 grid, the second player places an O into the same grid. Those two steps are repeated until the grid is full and there are no rows of the same symbol, which means a tie or either one of the players has a vertical, horizontal or diagonal row of 3 X’s or O’s, which implies a win for that player. As soon as the tiles have been filled with no rows of the same symbol, the game announces a tie, the same goes for if a player manages to fill a row with their symbol, the game announces a win for that player.
